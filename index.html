   <body style="background-color:rgb(226, 43, 217);" ><big>Every</big> person has a place where he feels secure and peaceful. A place where all troubles and challenges seem unimportant and where one can simply relax and forget about everything. My grandparents’ garden has always been such a place for me. I used to spend much time there when I was a child, and still go back to those happy years every time I visit my grandmother. Although the garden has nothing extraordinary about it, it is the best place for me to regain my inner strength. More importantly, it is the place that reminds me of who I am and who I want to be.
   <p>
   <r></r><hr> <big>My</big> grandparents spent more than 50 years in the village. They built a house and a nice backyard with a large vegetable garden. The house has only four rooms, but it is cozy and well-constructed. It has large windows with light blue frames and a gray rooftop with chimney. When I was young, my grandparents used to light the fire in the fireplace, so there was always a thin tail of smoke coming from the chimney in winter. I liked being in the house at winter and watch the snow fell down the trees, and I liked when the cat came to the house with snowflakes on his thick fur. Summertime was also wonderful because I could play in the yard, climb the trees, and eat fresh vegetables and fruits. Although my parents and I lived near the beach, I have always been more excited to stay with my grandparents in summer.
  <p>
  <r></r> <hr> <big>I</big> could name thousands of reasons why this place is so important for me. To begin with, it has a unique atmosphere of a family garden, which is cared for with warmth and dedication. Every spot in this place was made by my grandfather, and although he died a long time ago, his taste for details and his commitment is still seen in everything he touched. I also like this place because I feel safe here. When I come to visit my grandmother, I feel like I go back to my childhood, with all its carelessness and fun. No matter what wonderful places I visit, there would be no place where I would feel as secure and relaxed as here. I also love the rave of color in spring and summer, when everything is blossoming, and there are flowers all around. There is still my little flowerbed I planted when I was a child, and it is no nice to know that my grandmother cares for it.
   <p>
   <r></r><hr> <big>I</big> have many pleasant memories associated with my grandparents’ house. Although they are all blurry, I still feel the same warmth and happiness when I recall them. The first memory that comes to my mind now is cold winter mornings when I woke up in my bed and felt a smell of toasts in the kitchen. My grandfather made the best toasts ever, with a crispy crust, butter, and jam. He used to make me a cup of black tea and we sat together by the fire eating this simple, yet extremely delicious breakfast. I miss those days, but I hope that my house will be as comfortable for my own grandchildren as this place was for me. I would like to give them the same warmth and love my grandparents gave me when I was young. 
   <p>
   <r></r><hr><big>To</big>  conclude, I would like to note that no place would ever be so peaceful for me as my grandparents’ house. It has this unique quality to clear up all worries and problems in my mind and make me feel loved and cared for. I keep the memories of it in my heart to build my own house in future that would become a safe haven for my children and grandchildren.
